# DataPower Debug Logger

## Introduction

This project introduces a specialized logging system tailored for IBM DataPower Gateway. Designed for technical professionals, it offers a practical solution for debugging in environments that lack a comprehensive on-premise logging system. This tool is not for commercial use or as a full logging system replacement, but as an aid in specific debugging scenarios.

## Features

- **Delayed Logging**: Logs are captured with a 5-second delay, providing a balance between real-time insights and system performance.
- **Frontside Filtering**: Easily filter logs at the frontside to focus on relevant data.
- **Log Export**: Export logs to files on the server for detailed analysis and record-keeping.

## Installation

1.  Visit the Releases page of the repository.
2.  Download the latest release.
3.  Install NPM
4.  open terminal in the same folder of the server and run npm start

## Usage
